# July-2023 update

This project aims to enable develoeprs to add complex multi-step DeFi actions into their apps by leveraging the ERC-4337 capability of batching.

Over the last week we have taken a step back and analyzed what has been built and what the next steps we take should be.

# History

This is a derivative product of a feature that has been for some time powering DeFi Basket and its successor, [Picnic](https://www.usepicnic.com/). The concept of transaction batching is used along with a custom contract that executes batched calls with `delegatecall`. \[[picnic-contracts](https://github.com/usePicnic/picnic-contracts)\]

With the concept of account abstraction gaining momentum and transaction batching as a native feature of the [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard, it has become clear this is the direction we should steer toward.

## What does a batched transaction look like?

Suppose a transaction in which you want to transform all ETH deposited on Aave into USDC/DAI/USDT on Balancer staked for extra incentives.

This transaction is composed of the following steps:

1. Withdraw aToken from Aave
2. Approve ETH
3. Swap ETH for USDC
4. Approve USDC
5. Add USDC liquidity on Balancer
6. Approve LP token
7. Stake LP token

Typically these would be executed in distinct transactions on separate blocks. However due to the composable nature of DeFi, it is entirely possible to batch these transactions and execute all of them in a single block.

Do note that, in order to transform the _entire_ balance on the same block, the output amount of the preceding step(s) will often need to be used as the input amount of the following step. This needs to be done on-chain, as it is often impossible to know the precise amount until the transaction executes.

# Product

These are the main components of the product:

- an interface exposed through [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- a daemon running on `ts-node`
- a persistency layer on top of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

There will be two ways to interact with the transaction batcher.

1. Using procedures exposed by means of a tRPC router. [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) This optimizes development experience in a TypeScript environment.
2. Using an API exposed using REST endpoints. These will be exposed using [trpc-openapi](https://github.com/prosepilot/trpc-openapi).

# Interface

## get-assets

```
input:

{
  // Filters
}


output:

[{
  assetId: 'asset-id',
  name: 'text',
  symbol: 'text',
  logos: ['image', ..., 'image'],
  decimals: 'number',
  protocol: 'text',
  apy: 'number',

  // optional
  linkedAssets: [LinkedAsset,...,LinkedAsset],
  address: 'text',
  metadata: Object,
}]
```

## get-transaction-data

```
input:

{
  input: AllocationDescription[],
  output: AllocationDescription[],
}

output:

{
  assetIn: 'asset-id',
  assetOut: 'asset-id',
  amountIn: 'text',
  calldata: 'bytes',
  steps: ['Step', ..., 'Step'],
  userOp: UserOperation,
}
```

# Design decisions

- How to deal with rewards in `get-transaction-data`?
  - Rewards should be nested and specified both on `inputs` and `outputs`.
- Should we use `delegatecall` and should we use custom adapters?

  - Yes, due to the chained nature of transactions, in which the output amount of one transaction determines the input amount of the next.

- Should we use a `TokenStrategy` to intermediate?
- How to store assets? llama uses adapters, we use `json`?
- How to ensure compatability between ERC4337 wallets? `biconomy`?
